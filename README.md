# Principal Component Analysis
This repository saves one of the projects i've done while studying at UPNA, where I was prompted to build a model that predicts which class an image is.

This particular case utilices MNIST and EMNIST datasets, exploiting their handwritten numbers & letters to learn and predict which kind of number or letter the input is.

The project was part of the Knowledge Engineering subject, 3rd year of the Computer Science degree @ UPNA.
