# Principal Component Analysis
This project was done by **Nicolás Chareca**.

The project was part of the Knowledge Engineering subject, 3rd year of the [Computer Science Major](https://www.unavarra.es/en/sites/grados/informatica-y-telecomunicacion/ingenieria-informatica/presentacion.html) in the [Public University of Navarre](https://www.unavarra.es/home), in which I was prompted to build a model that predicts which class an image is.

This particular case utilices [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) and [EMNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database#Further_versions) datasets, exploiting their handwritten numbers & letters to learn and predict which kind of number or letter the input is.

It's divided in three different main files as this was explicitly requested in the project statement.
